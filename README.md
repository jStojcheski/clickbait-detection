# A Simple Approach to Clickbait Detection

#### Abstract
Nowadays, some of the biggest social networks/platforms already "declared war" against those posts that decreases the reader’s/viewer’s enjoyment of using their products by distracting them. Those posts are called clickbaits and their purpose is to catch the attention of the readers/viewers and to drag them to the website to which the clickbaits lead.


My primary motivation to try to detect clickbait headlines was the reason that I was (and probably still am) their "victim". In this article, I propose some simple approaches to successfully detect clickbait headlines. The classifier that achieved the highest level of accuracy overperformed each classifier proposed at the Clickbait Challenge 2017 workshop. How I’ve done that? As the best clickbait creators would say: "This man found a MAGICAL approach to detect clickbait headlines and his solution will SHOCK you!".
